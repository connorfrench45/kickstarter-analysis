# Kickstarting with Excel
A spreadsheet examining how to maximize Kickstarter success specifically centered on Theater campaigns

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter success seems random, but what if we can use other campaigns' failures and successes to help determine future Camapign success? Here we look at how launch date and goal amount affect success
 
### Purpose
What paramenters that go into a Kickstarter Campaign Launch affect the outcome and at what rate?

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The date the Kickstarter Launches has a significant affect on success 

![Theater Outcomes vs Launch Date](/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

- The success rate of Kickstarters launched in May through July is high with a high number of campaigns launched
- The number of Failed campaigns is fairly consistent throughout the year, but the number of successful campaigns drops significantly after the peak months
- Canceled campaigns is a consistently small number throughout the year

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The chance of a campaign succeeding went down as the goal amount increased:

![Outcomes vs Goal Amount](/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

- Goal less than $1000: 76% successful
- Goal between $1,000 and $4,999: 73% successful
- Goal between $5,000 and $9,999: 55% successful
- Goal between $10,000 and $14,999: 54% successful

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Only looking at Kickstarter statistics can overshadow outside factors. We can't know if Kickstarters we're more successful if they were advertised on certain platforms, for instance, or if other factors like the popularity of the creators had any affect. Also, these factors describes only correlated with success, rather than necessarily causing success.
These strategies are best when figuring out how to launch a campaign. For effective post-launch strategies, there would have to be a different analysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - Success is highest from May through July
  - Failure is consistent throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - A campaign with a goal of less than $5,000 is far more successful (~75% success rate) than campaigns with goals greater than $5,000 (~50% success rate)

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - The data only covered a few years of Kickstarters and less than 1500 theater Kickstarters from around the globe. A larger data set would help clarify trends and multiple years of data could show trends that are emerging or dissipating.
  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Seeing the effect of the "Staff Pick" or "Spotlight" designations could provide useful insight. Looking at the effect of average backer size could also help focus the campaign.
