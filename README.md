# Kickstarter Analysis for Finding Successful Theater Campaign Strategies
A spreadsheet examining how to maximize Kickstarter success specifically centered on Theater campaigns

## Results

#### Launch Date
The date the Kickstarter Launches has a significant affect on success 
![]/whatevertheimagelinkis

- The success rate of Kickstarters launched in May through July is high with a high number of campaigns launched
- The number of Failed campaigns is fairly consistent throughout the year, but the number of successful campaigns drops significantly after the peak months
- Cancelled campaigns is a consistently small number throughout the year

#### Goal Amount
The chance of a campaign succeeding went down as the goal amount increased:

- Goal less than $1000: 76% successful
- Goal between $1,000 and $4,999: 73% successful
- Goal between $5,000 and $9,999: 55% successful
- Goal between $10,000 and $14,999: 54% successful

#### Limitations
The data only covered a few years of Kickstarters and less than 1500 theater Kickstarters from around the globe. A larger data set would help clarify trends and multiple years of data could show trends that are emerging or dissipating.

Other factors that could be examined is the effect of being a "Staff Pick" or "Spotlight" Kickstarter, as well as examining the effect of average backer size. That information could help with running a successful campaign after its launch

## Analysis
For the most successful campaign, a kickstarter launched in May with a goal amount less than $5,000 would give the best opportunity.
Any goal higher than $5,000 would be like flipping a coin for success:

Any other Launch date would saturate the lower backer pool:

#### Challenges
Only looking at Kickstarter statistics can overshadow outside factors. We can't know if Kickstarters we're more successful if they were advertised on certain platforms, for instance, or if other factors like the popularity of the creators had any affect. Also, these factors describes only correlated with success, rather than necessarily causing success.
These strategies are best when figuring out how to launch a campaign. For effective post-launch strategies, there would have to be a different analysis.
